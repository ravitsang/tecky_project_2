<p id="6fe1" class="go gp ed at gq b gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb dv">Another day in the Winter break. The ever looming blade of getting a full time job compels me to go to Indeed.com. I use the Advanced Search set my preferences, location, radius around the location, job title, entry level, full time, how long ago the jobs was posted (I prioritize applying to jobs no older than 15 days) the usual stuff. Hit search and the nightmare begins.</p><figure class="hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk bv hl hm hn ho hp bg hq hr hs ht hu hv paragraph-image"><div class="hw hx hy hz ak"><div class="dm dn hc"><div class="if r hy ig"><div class="ih r"><div class="ia ib dq t u ic ak cd id ie"><img class="dq t u ic ak ii ij ik" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*Ms_Ub7T5hbxxaSA_ogk1Fg.png?q=20" width="1558" height="1008" role="presentation"></div><img class="ia ib dq t u ic ak hj" width="1558" height="1008" role="presentation"><noscript><img class="dq t u ic ak" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3116/1*Ms_Ub7T5hbxxaSA_ogk1Fg.png" width="1558" height="1008" role="presentation"></noscript></div></div></div></div><figcaption class="ax fg il im in do dm dn io ip as cv">Advanced Search does have good parameters.</figcaption></figure><p id="c2c6" class="go gp ed at gq b gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb dv">Now, before I complain about Indeed for no reason. I consider it to be one of the best websites for job search — in fact, I got my summer internship through Indeed. It has a great collection of relevant jobs and a nice set of filtering options. But finding full time jobs is kind of a mess because of the wider range of job type that all fall under the same umbrella.</p><ul class=""><li id="4e7c" class="go gp ed at gq b gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb iq ir is">First, there’s almost way too many results, for this instance 375 to be precise. (which is also a good thing?)</li><li id="46b7" class="go gp ed at gq b gr it gt iu gv iv gx iw gz ix hb iq ir is">Second, even though I filter for entry level jobs, the description often has a minimum work ex requirement — while It may not necessarily be entry level = 0 work experience, but having jobs with requirement of 5+ years under entry level is doing no good to anyone.</li><li id="de11" class="go gp ed at gq b gr it gt iu gv iv gx iw gz ix hb iq ir is">Third, I would eventually stumble upon Intern positions — again not what I am looking for. (So Internship ⊆ Full Time? maybe but come on..)</li><li id="d4d4" class="go gp ed at gq b gr it gt iu gv iv gx iw gz ix hb iq ir is">And four, it takes too much time, I’ve already filtered and filtered and I still find results that do not work for me.</li></ul><p id="d833" class="go gp ed at gq b gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb dv">If only I could do this entire chore of going through each and every job title, job description and eliminating unsuitable ones and consolidating the right ones in one place. Well, yes I can, with Python. I consider Python to be a great automation tool, with its rich set of libraries and intuitive syntax, be it data cleaning or arranging my desktop, it never lets me down.</p><p id="6768" class="go gp ed at gq b gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb dv">First, task is to find out if at all the job title matches my need. But, how do I know where is what on the webpage and how will my code know that. Lucky for me, Indeed has a very well defined html page structure and I can leverage the semantic class and id tags. View the page source or simply “inspect element” on your choice of page element. And Voila!</p><figure class="hd he hf hg hh hi dm dn paragraph-image"><div class="hw hx hy hz ak"><div class="dm dn iy"><div class="if r hy ig"><div class="iz r"><div class="ia ib dq t u ic ak cd id ie"><img class="dq t u ic ak ii ij ik" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*Gr045Y6zJLC2wFuVyUyDNQ.png?q=20" width="2766" height="1230" role="presentation"></div><img class="ia ib dq t u ic ak hj" width="2766" height="1230" role="presentation"><noscript><img class="dq t u ic ak" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/5532/1*Gr045Y6zJLC2wFuVyUyDNQ.png" width="2766" height="1230" role="presentation"></noscript></div></div></div></div><figcaption class="ax fg il im in do dm dn io ip as cv">Its all right there.</figcaption></figure><p id="9bec" class="go gp ed at gq b gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb dv">If you look closer. All results have the class tag “result”. That’s great, something to begin coding. Lets head over to <em class="ja">atom. </em><strong class="gq jb">BeautifulSoup</strong> is a great tool for all things HTML. Plus, it is great for nested search of elements and attributes.

After doing some more filtering from this information I use the URL to get the job description and get <strong class="gq jb">regex </strong>to find out if its good for me. The regex here checks for 2 things :</p><ol class=""><li id="b95e" class="go gp ed at gq b gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb jt ir is">The required previous experience is not more than 1 year.</li><li id="4c23" class="go gp ed at gq b gr it gt iu gv iv gx iw gz ix hb jt ir is">It should not be limited to US Citizens.</li></ol><p id="27f9" class="go gp ed at gq b gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb dv">If I find either of these in a description, it is thrown out as not suitable.</p><pre class="hd he hf hg hh jk jl cm"><span id="6228" class="jm jn ed at jf b fg jo jp r jq">p1 = re.compile('[2-9]\s*\+?-?\s*[2-9]?\s*[yY]e?a?r[Ss]?')<br>p2 = re.compile('[Cc]itizen(ship)?')</span></pre><p id="c1a2" class="go gp ed at gq b gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb dv">As evident, I may have played it fast and loose with the regular expressions.
