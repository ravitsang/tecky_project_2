<p id="a5b3" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz cu">Today’s project is a web scraper! I have always been curious about what web scraping is about and how to do it.</p><p id="6a07" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz cu">Apparently, after hours of researching, there is an easy way to do it using Puppeteer. I followed a youtube tutorial closely and I got it done in less than an hour! Yay! Or so I thought…</p><p id="5101" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz cu">My initial plan was to scrape some data then display it on a HTML page. So as usual, I attached &lt;script&gt; to my HTML but something went very wrong…</p><p id="66ae" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz cu">ERROR: ‘require is not defined’. Oh boy, I thought. So I researched what this error is about and apparently the keyword require cannot be used for client-side execution. In other words, no browsers. Boo.</p><p id="562e" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz cu">It took me another 2 hours and more to figure out what to do from here. Am I satisfied with just this back-end but completed web scraper? Or do I want a page too? After browsing and reading about browserify, I decided to have a page! But… Oh dear. Issues after issues that I don’t understand. After researching more, I’m back to square one — which is having no page because apparently, Browserify and Puppeteer don’t like each other…</p><p id="9d2a" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz cu">Ok, so fine, I thought. Let’s just push this to gitHub without the front-end… ERROR! File exceeded 100MB! *slaps face* Nothing seems to be going right today… It turns out that the “node_modules” folder which contains the Puppeteer module is over 145MB and I honestly have no idea why it is so large so I deleted it and put it in the README.md. The long day seems to finally come to an end.</p><p id="97d6" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz cu">But wait! The front-end is not complete. All I have now is some data scraped by scraper.js. I can’t let it go to waste! So I save them to the JSON file while learning about File System in Nodejs. Very handy! After saving the JSON, I load it up to a HTML page into a table dynamically (learned from <a class="at cg ga gb gc gd" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="/@victoria2666/100-days-of-code-day-3-of-100-d2141c4e7932">Day 3</a>)! BAM! Front and back now all covered and this noob feels accomplished for the day.</p><p id="1c7f" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz cu"><strong class="fo ge">The Project: </strong><a href="https://victoria-lo.github.io/GameScraper/" class="at cg ga gb gc gd" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameScraper</a></p><p id="90bd" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz cu"><strong class="fo ge">What I Learn:</strong></p><ul class=""><li id="54f3" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz gf gg gh">WEB SCRAPING!</li><li id="c030" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp gi fr gj ft gk fv gl fx gm fz gf gg gh">Save data to local JSON using File System module</li><li id="1c79" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp gi fr gj ft gk fv gl fx gm fz gf gg gh">Using Puppeteer and how large it is in memory</li><li id="beec" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp gi fr gj ft gk fv gl fx gm fz gf gg gh">GitHub’s size limit is 100MB (good to know)</li><li id="11cd" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp gi fr gj ft gk fv gl fx gm fz gf gg gh">There’s too much StackOverflow forums addressing the same issues/problems that my brain got overloaded</li></ul><p id="fe66" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz cu"><strong class="fo ge">What I Did Not Learn:</strong></p><ul class=""><li id="2db1" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz gf gg gh">Browserify</li><li id="a61d" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp gi fr gj ft gk fv gl fx gm fz gf gg gh">How to make require() work for client-side</li><li id="3eda" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp gi fr gj ft gk fv gl fx gm fz gf gg gh">Why Puppeteer is so large</li></ul><p id="08b3" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz cu"><strong class="fo ge">Thoughts:</strong></p><p id="a6cd" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz cu">Today was exhausting because it felt like I made no progress ever since I got the scraper running. The scraper is the main topic I want to learn today so actually, I could have been done within an hour but I just had to be all ambitious and research stuff. But it all ended in vain so it felt exhausting to me. Overall, I am still glad that I learnt how to scrape data from other sites.</p>
