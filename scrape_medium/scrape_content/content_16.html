<p id="066d" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz cu">I recently became familiar with the process of using website API’s and/or how to do web scraping, to extract words or tables from websites, to become a source of data for machine learning purposes. That in itself was pretty interesting, but what you can do with all that information, particularly with words, is fascinating. Welcome to the world of Natural Language Processing (NLP).</p><p id="eef1" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz cu">NLP has become on of my favorite subjects I have learned in my Data Science learning. Being able to take a post from Reddit, or comments from Amazon, or an article from a webpage, and to create a predictive model from that blows my mind. I mean, how can words be treated like numerical values?! But if start thinking about it, certain words can define who wrote/said in a statement, and if you can identify that, you now have a feature you can help predict on. Finding the occurence of the number of times a word shows up can hold a lot of power.</p><p id="8f7e" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz cu">For instance, the phrase “Make America Great Again” is President Trump’s slogan. If I am trying to predict if an article or post is written by a democrat or republican, and those words show up in that record, with some tuning, the model would probably predict if a republican wrote that post, or if there are ties to the Republican party, or even Trump himself.</p><p id="6eec" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz cu">At the time I was learning this, there was the big news of someone close in Trump’s cabinet that wrote a very incriminating letter of Trump’s alleged missteps as President. Nobody knew who wrote it, but I came across several news reports and articles, where Data Scientists were using NLP to try and find who wrote the article, comparing how certain words were used, compared to a number of other published articles from Trump’s cabinet over the years. Talk about relevant and an exciting use of techniques! It is like being a data detective! That just increased my excitement more and more to dive into the NLP process further.</p><p id="3b2b" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz cu">I also had an opportunity to talk with a Data Science company, and they had just finished a project using NLP to look for gender discrimination in employee reviews, and they were successful at building a model that helped find these type of discriminatory reviews. Words hold power and can have equal weight, if applied right, to predicting outcomes. The old saying “Sticks and stones can break my bones but words will never hurt me” is something we all know is not true, but apply the concepts of NLP to words, and words might actually be more of a threat than a feature of just rocks and sticks!</p>
